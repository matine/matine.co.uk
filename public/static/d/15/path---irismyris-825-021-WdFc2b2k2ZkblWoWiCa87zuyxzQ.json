The aim was to ‘Hand the reins of your career over to you. Take control, create your happy successful future and make a difference’. Initially we built a tool to create a profile for yourself with your own ‘brand, promise, goals and learning agenda’, and an area for annual check-ins with your career coach. However we have since expanded it to more of an internal tool where people can now book holidays/out of office’s and others can easily view who’s off, search for contact details and view each others profiles. It is now well used worldwide, throughout all 13 of the iris offices."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"irismyris"}}
