The site needed to be simple,Â  functional and allow the client to easily upload latest works, via linking from their current platform, Vimeo. I designed a new logo for the company, and designed and built the site. The landing page displays a full size background video and subtle animated branding, whilst the rest of the site is clean, strong and simple, and works well across various devices."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"runningfilms"}}
