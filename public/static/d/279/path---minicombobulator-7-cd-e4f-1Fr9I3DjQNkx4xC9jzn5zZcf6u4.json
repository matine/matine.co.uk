The interactive interface includes number of seats, MPG, speed, luggage, price and other options such as connectivity and drop top roof. I inherited this project half way built and the complex logic and interactivity made for an interesting handover. However it was well worth the struggle and looked great and worked well once it was complete. Later, I built the second phase which was a re-skin to a white version, aligning with the latest Mini rebranding."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"minicombobulator"}}
