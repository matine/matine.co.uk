All driven by the Pod Point API, but a completely fresh design/UX and build to recreate the existing functionality of the old app, as well as adding new additional features including showing user history and stats, and home charging integration. The UI is built with functional components separating from components tied to the state, so these pieces are more reusable and building out new views and containers is much quicker."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"podpointopenchargeapp"}}
