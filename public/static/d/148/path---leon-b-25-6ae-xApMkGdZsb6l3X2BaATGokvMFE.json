The brief was to pick a favourite film, create a 3-5 page website which promotes a fictional re-release date of the film at a local cinema. The focus of the website was not on the build and functionality, but on the visual aspect. The design should evoke the feel and emotion of that film."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"leon"}}
