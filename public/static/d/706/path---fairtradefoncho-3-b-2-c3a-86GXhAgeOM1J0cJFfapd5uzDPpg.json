The campaign, lead byÂ Karma Comms, was to encourage people to sign a petition to help Foncho, by making the experience fun and interactive. The look and feel of the page is colourful and has animated elements, for example, stickers populating the page on load and on scroll. We also made the signing of the petition form engaging by building an interactive sticker using canvas. As the user completes the petition form, their name and face is added to the virtual sticker, in real time. On complete of the form, a banana animates up and the personalised sticker sticks on it."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"fairtradefoncho"}}
