Users had the chance to make a pledge to transform an unloved room in their house, via Intagram, Twitter or directly on the site. The winners received B&Q vouchers, which they then recorded the process of decorating their room, including which B&Q products they used. The site was built on a custom PHP backend and inserted into an iframe on the main B&Q site. I was one of two front end developers on the project."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"bqunlovedrooms"}}
