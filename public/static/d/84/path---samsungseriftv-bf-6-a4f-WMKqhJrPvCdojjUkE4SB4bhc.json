The product was designed by the acclaimed design duo, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, and aims to “blur the lines between furniture and technology”. The website was designed and built to reflect the soft, subtle and elegant aesthetic of the product itself – taking elements such as ‘curtain’ mode from the product and translating that within the site. The pages of the site let the user explore the ‘design’, ‘craft’ and ‘lifestyle’ of the Serif TV, as well as the product range and a store locator."}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"samsungseriftv"}}
