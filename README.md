I'm always rebuilding my portfolio in different ways as a way of learning the latest tools.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the most recent version of the Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## UI styling


All of the UI has been styled with the Styled Components and Styled System.

### Styled Components
Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier! Read more [here](https://www.styled-components.com/).

### Styled System
Design system utilities for styled-components and other css-in-js libraries. 
Add style props that hook into your own theme. Responsive prop values for quickly setting responsive font-size, margin, padding, width, and more. Check the github page [here](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system).

## Content

Content is handled by Prismic which is a CMS – content management system.
Specifically, a headless, API-first, hosted, proprietary CMS – with a web app for creating and publishing content. Try it out [here](https://prismic.io/). 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

Starts the app, and can be debugged in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon.
